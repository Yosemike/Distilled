          The Daily Blueprint is your zone to download your thoughts and envision the day. Two thoughtfully designed pages for your daily morning ritual, for clarifying your mind, plan your manifestations for the day and focused intentions. Open these 2 pages up in the morning, write your visions out. 
        </p>
       <p>
         If you can conceive it, you can believe it. If you can believe it, you can achieve it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Daily Blueprint is the journal page to position yourself to win the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Daily Blueprint gives you these spaces:
        </p>
        <h2 id="Mindset check">
          Mindset check
        </h2>
        <p>
          How are you feeling, right now? Write it down. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re feeling energised, great. Keep the momentum throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re feeling lazy or unmotivated, be honest with yourself. Recognise your emotion and go make yourself feel better by planning your day with this journal.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Yesterday’s win">
          Yesterday’s win
        </h2>
        <p>
          Celebrate your success, no matter how small. Every little victory brings you a step closer to your dreams. Never underestimate the power of compound interest. 
        </p>
        <p>
          List your wins and ignite the positive momentum.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Today’s vision">
          Today’s vision
        </h2>
        <p>
          Zoom in. The day is what you set it out to be. Visualise success and orchestrate it to fall into your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you write it down, your vision becomes your reality.
        </p>

          First things first. They say go for the low-hanging fruits, I say do what’s important when you’re the freshest. Once you finish what you must do before noon, whatever happens in the rest of the day, you’ve already won the day.
        </p>
        <h2 id="3 not-to-do">
          3 not-to-do

        <p>
          Distraction is the enemy of your success. This section allows you to tune out the noises, define what are the distractions that divert your attention to your goals. Write them down or risk losing your clarity. Victory requires you to have your eyes on the target.

        <p>
          Plans don’t always work, but you need one. If you can visualise your day, you can manifest it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Set your priorities right the day before so you can hit the ground running from the get-go.

          What’s lingering in your mind? Be it an idea, an unsolved problem or an inspiration — download them to this section so that it doesn’t get trapped in your head. Problems become solvable when you write them down and ideas become reality when you write them down.
        </p>
        <p>
          End the day with a sense of fulfilment.
