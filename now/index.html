          <h2>Hi, I'm Distill Mike.</h2>
          <p>
            I write, take informative notes and share snippets of my ideas on
            Twitter @distillmike
          </p>

          <p>Each week, I write two popular emails.</p>
          <p>
            Monday Musings is a collection of the coolest things I learn every
            week. Meanwhile, Friday Finds is a links-only newsletter where I
            only share the kinds of ideas you won’t find anywhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            My essays cross between topics like travel, culture, media,
            marketing, and technology. Nevertheless, the majority of my essays
            orbit around our relationship with information, especially how we
            make sense of the world by consuming ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            My most popular short articles include The Price of Discipline, The
            Never-Ending Now, and One Big Idea. And if you want to read some
            long-form essays, I recommend What the Hell is Going On, News in the
            Age of Abundance, and Peter Thiel’s Religion. Or, if you want a
            short introduction to my thinking, you’ll like 50 Ideas that Changed
            My Life.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to see all my writing on a single page, you’ll find all
            my essays here.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m on a mission to teach thousands of people to write online, share
            their ideas, and build an online audience. In order to do that, I
            teach an online course called Write of Passage. In five weeks of
            intense instruction, I give hundreds of students the tools to
            publish their ideas, build an online audience, and accelerate their
            career. The essence of the course is described in my essay, The
            Ultimate Guide to Writing Online. Students also leave with a network
            of friends who share their curiosity for learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next Write of Passage cohort begins in February 2021. If you
            want to join, let me know by entering your email here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the world of writing, I host two podcasts. One where I do the
            talking, and one where I do the interviewing. The Write of Passage
            Podcast is a collection of deep-dives into the writing process.
            Meanwhile, the North Star Podcast is a collection of almost 100
            interviews with all kinds of high-performers including Seth Godin,
            Ryan Holiday, Erika Nardini, Tyler Cowen, and Jason Fried.

            You can also find me on Twitter and if you want to email me, send a
            note to hello@perell.com.
